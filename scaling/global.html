<h1>4.1 Global Internet<a class="headerlink" href="#global-internet" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>At this point, we have seen how to connect a heterogeneous collection of
networks to create an internetwork and how to use the simple hierarchy
of the IP address to make routing in an internet somewhat scalable. We
say “somewhat” scalable because, even though each router does not need
to know about all the hosts connected to the internet, it does, in the
model described so far, need to know about all the networks connected to
the internet. Today’s Internet has hundreds of thousands of networks
connected to it (or more, depending on how you count). Routing protocols
such as those we have just discussed do not scale to those kinds of
numbers. This section looks at a variety of techniques that greatly
improve scalability and that have enabled the Internet to grow as far as
it has.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id1">
<span id="fig-inet-tree"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f04-01-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f04-01-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f04-01-9780123850591.png" style="width: 600px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 97: </span><span class="caption-text">The tree structure of the Internet in 1990.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Before getting to these techniques, we need to have a general picture in
our heads of what the global Internet looks like. It is not just a
random interconnection of Ethernets, but instead it takes on a shape
that reflects the fact that it interconnects many different
organizations. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-inet-tree"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 1</span></a> gives a simple depiction of the
state of the Internet in 1990. Since that time, the Internet’s topology
has grown much more complex than this figure suggests—we present a
slightly more accurate picture of the current Internet in a later
section—but this picture will do for now.</p>
<p>One of the salient features of this topology is that it consists of
end-user sites (e.g., Stanford University) that connect to service
provider networks (e.g., BARRNET was a provider network that served
sites in the San Francisco Bay Area). In 1990, many providers served a
limited geographic region and were thus known as <em>regional networks</em>.
The regional networks were, in turn, connected by a nationwide backbone.
In 1990, this backbone was funded by the National Science Foundation
(NSF) and was therefore called the <em>NSFNET backbone</em>.</p>
<p>NSFNET gave way to Internet2, which still runs a backbone on behalf of
Research and Education institutions in the US (there are similar R&amp;E
networks in other countries), but of course most people get their
Internet connectivity from commercial providers. Although the detail is
not shown in the figure, today the largest provider networks (they are
called tier-1) are typically built from dozens of high-end routers
located in major meteropolitan areas (colloquially referred to as “NFL
cities”) connected by point-to-point links (often with 100 Gbps
capacity). Similarly, each end-user site is typically not a single
network but instead consists of multiple physical networks connected by
switches and routers.</p>
<p>Notice in that each provider and end-user is likely to be an
administratively independent entity. This has some significant
consequences on routing. For example, it is quite likely that different
providers will have different ideas about the best routing protocol to
use within their networks and on how metrics should be assigned to links
in their network. Because of this independence, each provider’s network
is usually a single <em>autonomous system</em> (AS). We will define this term
more precisely in a later section, but for now it is adequate to think
of an AS as a network that is administered independently of other ASs.</p>
<p>The fact that the Internet has a discernible structure can be used to
our advantage as we tackle the problem of scalability. In fact, we need
to deal with two related scaling issues. The first is the scalability of
routing. We need to find ways to minimize the number of network numbers
that get carried around in routing protocols and stored in the routing
tables of routers. The second is address utilization—that is, making
sure that the IP address space does not get consumed too quickly.</p>
<p>Throughout this book, we see the principle of hierarchy used again and
again to improve scalability. We saw in the previous chapter how the
hierarchical structure of IP addresses, especially with the flexibility
provided by Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR) and subnetting, can
improve the scalability of routing. In the next two sections, we’ll see
further uses of hierarchy (and its partner, aggregation) to provide
greater scalability, first in a single domain and then between domains.
Our final subsection looks at IP version 6, the invention of which was
largely the result of scalability concerns.</p>
<div class="section" id="routing-areas">
<h2>Routing Areas<a class="headerlink" href="#routing-areas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As a first example of using hierarchy to scale up the routing system,
we’ll examine how link-state routing protocols (such as OSPF and IS-IS)
can be used to partition a routing domain into subdomains called
<em>areas</em>. (The terminology varies somewhat among protocols—we use the
OSPF terminology here.) By adding this extra level of hierarchy, we
enable single domains to grow larger without overburdening the routing
protocols or resorting to the more complex interdomain routing protocols
described later.</p>
<p>An area is a set of routers that are administratively configured to
exchange link-state information with each other. There is one special
area—the backbone area, also known as area&nbsp;0. An example of a routing
domain divided into areas is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ospf-area"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 2</span></a> .
Routers R1, R2, and R3 are members of the backbone area. They are also
members of at least one nonbackbone area; R1 is actually a member of
both area&nbsp;1 and area&nbsp;2. A&nbsp;router that is a member of both the backbone
area and a nonbackbone area is an area border router (ABR). Note that
these are distinct from the routers that are at the edge of an AS, which
are referred to as AS border routers for clarity.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id2">
<span id="fig-ospf-area"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f04-02-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f04-02-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f04-02-9780123850591.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 98: </span><span class="caption-text">A domain divided into areas.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Routing within a single area is exactly as described in the previous
chapter. All the routers in the area send link-state advertisements to
each other and thus develop a complete, consistent map of the area.
However, the link-state advertisements of routers that are not area
border routers do not leave the area in which they originated. This has
the effect of making the flooding and route calculation processes
considerably more scalable. For example, router R4 in area&nbsp;3 will never
see a link-state advertisement from router R8 in area&nbsp;1. As a
consequence, it will know nothing about the detailed topology of areas
other than its own.</p>
<p>How, then, does a router in one area determine the right next hop for a
packet destined to a network in another area? The answer to this becomes
clear if we imagine the path of a packet that has to travel from one
nonbackbone area to another as being split into three parts. First, it
travels from its source network to the backbone area, then it crosses
the backbone, then it travels from the backbone to the destination
network. To make this work, the area border routers summarize routing
information that they have learned from one area and make it available
in their advertisements to other areas. For example, R1 receives
link-state advertisements from all the routers in area&nbsp;1 and can thus
determine the cost of reaching any network in area 1. When R1 sends
link-state advertisements into area&nbsp;0, it advertises the costs of
reaching the networks in area&nbsp;1 much as if all those networks were
directly connected to R1. This enables all the area&nbsp;0 routers to learn
the cost to reach all networks in area&nbsp;1. The area border routers then
summarize this information and advertise it into the nonbackbone areas.
Thus, all routers learn how to reach all networks in the domain.</p>
<p>Note that, in the case of area&nbsp;2, there are two ABRs and that routers in
area&nbsp;2 will thus have to make a choice as to which one they use to reach
the backbone. This is easy enough, since both R1 and R2 will be
advertising costs to various networks, so it will become clear which is
the better choice as the routers in area&nbsp;2 run their shortest-path
algorithm. For example, it is pretty clear that R1 is going to be a
better choice than R2 for destinations in area&nbsp;1.</p>
<p>When dividing a domain into areas, the network administrator makes a
tradeoff between scalability and optimality of routing. The use of areas
forces all packets traveling from one area to another to go via the
backbone area, even if a shorter path might have been available. For
example, even if R4 and R5 were directly connected, packets would not
flow between them because they are in different nonbackbone areas. It
turns out that the need for scalability is often more important than the
need to use the absolute shortest path.</p>
<div class="admonition-key-takeaway admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Key Takeaway</p>
<p class="last">This illustrates an important principle in network design. There is
frequently a trade-off between scalability and some sort of
optimality. When hierarchy is introduced, information is hidden from
some nodes in the network, hindering their ability to make perfect
decisions. However, information hiding is essential to scalability,
since it saves all nodes from having global knowledge. It is
invariably true in large networks that scalability is a more pressing
design goal than selecting the optimal route.</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, we note that there is a trick by which network administrators
can more flexibly decide which routers go in area&nbsp;0. This trick uses the
idea of a <em>virtual link</em> between routers. Such a virtual link is
obtained by configuring a router that is not directly connected to
area&nbsp;0 to exchange backbone routing information with a router that is.
For example, a virtual link could be configured from R8 to R1, thus
making R8 part of the backbone. R8 would now participate in link-state
advertisement flooding with the other routers in area&nbsp;0. The cost of the
virtual link from R8 to R1 is determined by the exchange of routing
information that takes place in area&nbsp;1. This technique can help to
improve the optimality of routing.</p>

<div class="section" id="interdomain-routing-bgp">
<h2>Interdomain Routing (BGP)<a class="headerlink" href="#interdomain-routing-bgp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At the beginning of this chapter, we introduced the notion that the
Internet is organized as autonomous systems, each of which is under the
control of a single administrative entity. A corporation’s complex
internal network might be a single AS, as may the national network of
any single Internet Service Provider (ISP). <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-autonomous"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 3</span></a>
shows a simple network with two autonomous systems.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id3">
<span id="fig-autonomous"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f04-03-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f04-03-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f04-03-9780123850591.png" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 99: </span><span class="caption-text">A network with two autonomous systems.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The basic idea behind autonomous systems is to provide an additional way
to hierarchically aggregate routing information in a large internet,
thus improving scalability. We now divide the routing problem into two
parts: routing within a single autonomous system and routing between
autonomous systems. Since another name for autonomous systems in the
Internet is routing <em>domains</em>, we refer to the two parts of the routing
problem as interdomain routing and intradomain routing. In addition to
improving scalability, the AS model decouples the intradomain routing
that takes place in one AS from that taking place in another. Thus, each
AS can run whatever intradomain routing protocols it chooses. It can
even use static routes or multiple protocols, if desired. The
interdomain routing problem is then one of having different ASs share
reachability information—descriptions of the set of IP addresses that
can be reached via a given AS—with each other.</p>
<div class="section" id="challenges-in-interdomain-routing">
<h3>Challenges in Interdomain Routing<a class="headerlink" href="#challenges-in-interdomain-routing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Perhaps the most important challenge of interdomain routing today is the
need for each AS to determine its own routing <em>policies</em>. A simple
example routing policy implemented at a particular AS might look like
this: “Whenever possible, I prefer to send traffic via AS X than via AS
Y, but I’ll use AS Y if it is the only path, and I never want to carry
traffic from AS X to AS Y or <em>vice versa</em>.” Such a policy would be
typical when I have paid money to both AS X and AS Y to connect my AS to
the rest of the Internet, and AS X is my preferred provider of
connectivity, with AS Y being the fallback. Because I view both AS X and
AS Y as providers (and presumably I paid them to play this role), I
don’t expect to help them out by carrying traffic between them across my
network (this is called <em>transit</em> traffic). The more autonomous systems
I connect to, the more complex policies I&nbsp;might have, especially when
you consider backbone providers, who may interconnect with dozens of
other providers and hundreds of customers and have different economic
arrangements (which affect routing policies) with each one.</p>
<p>A key design goal of interdomain routing is that policies like the
example above, and much more complex ones, should be supported by the
interdomain routing system. To make the problem harder, I need to be
able to implement such a policy without any help from other autonomous
systems, and in the face of possible misconfiguration or malicious
behavior by other autonomous systems. Furthermore, there is often a
desire to keep the policies <em>private</em>, because the entities that run the
autonomous systems—mostly ISPs—are often in competition with each other
and don’t want their economic arrangements made public.</p>
<p>There have been two major interdomain routing protocols in the history
of the Internet. The first was the Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP),
which had a number of limitations, perhaps the most severe of which was
that it constrained the topology of the Internet rather significantly.
EGP was designed when the Internet had a treelike topology, such as that
illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-inet-tree"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 1</span></a>, and did not allow for the
topology to become more general. Note that in this simple treelike
structure there is a single backbone, and autonomous systems are
connected only as parents and children and not as peers.</p>
<p>The replacement for EGP was the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which has
iterated through four versions (BGP-4). BGP is often regarded as one of
the more complex parts of the Internet. We’ll cover some of its high
points here.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor EGP, BGP makes virtually no assumptions about how
autonomous systems are interconnected—they form an arbitrary graph. This
model is clearly general enough to accommodate non-tree-structured
internetworks, like the simplified picture of a multi-provider Internet
shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-inet-1995"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 4</span></a>. (It turns out there is still some
sort of structure to the Internet, as we’ll see below, but it’s nothing
like as simple as a tree, and BGP makes no assumptions about such
structure.)</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id4">
<span id="fig-inet-1995"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f04-04-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f04-04-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f04-04-9780123850591.png" style="width: 600px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 100: </span><span class="caption-text">A simple multi-provider Internet.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Unlike the simple tree-structured Internet shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-inet-tree"><span class="std std-ref">Figure
1</span></a>, or even the fairly simple picture in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-inet-1995"><span class="std std-ref">Figure
4</span></a>, today’s Internet consists of a richly interconnected
set of networks, mostly operated by private companies (ISPs) rather than
governments. Many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) exist mainly to
provide service to “consumers” (i.e., individuals with computers in
their homes), while others offer something more like the old backbone
service, interconnecting other providers and sometimes larger
corporations. Often, many providers arrange to interconnect with each
other at a single <em>peering point</em>.</p>
<p>To get a better sense of how we might manage routing among this complex
interconnection of autonomous systems, we can start by defining a few
terms. We define <em>local traffic</em> as traffic that originates at or
terminates on nodes within an AS, and <em>transit traffic</em> as traffic that
passes through an AS. We can classify autonomous systems into three
broad types:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Stub AS—an AS that has only a single connection to one other AS; such
an AS will only carry local traffic. The small corporation in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-inet-1995"><span class="std std-ref">Figure
4</span></a> is an example of a stub AS.</li>
<li>Multihomed AS—an AS that has connections to more than one other AS
but that refuses to carry transit traffic, such as the large
corporation at the top of <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-inet-1995"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 4</span></a>.</li>
<li>Transit AS—an AS that has connections to more than one other AS and
that is designed to carry both transit and local traffic, such as the
backbone providers in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-inet-1995"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 4</span></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whereas the discussion of routing in the previous chapter focused on
finding optimal paths based on minimizing some sort of link metric, the
goals of interdomain routing are rather more complex. First, it is
necessary to find <em>some</em> path to the intended destination that is loop
free. Second, paths must be compliant with the policies of the various
autonomous systems along the path—and, as we have already seen, those
policies might be almost arbitrarily complex. Thus, while intradomain
focuses on a well-defined problem of optimizing the scalar cost of the
path, interdomain focuses on finding a non-looping, <em>policy-compliant</em>
path—a much more complex optimization problem.</p>
<p>There are additional factors that make interdomain routing hard. The
first is simply a matter of scale. An Internet backbone router must be
able to forward any packet destined anywhere in the Internet. That means
having a routing table that will provide a match for any valid IP
address. While CIDR has helped to control the number of distinct
prefixes that are carried in the Internet’s backbone routing, there is
inevitably a lot of routing information to pass around—roughly 700,000
prefixes in mid-2018.</p>
<p>A further challenge in interdomain routing arises from the autonomous
nature of the domains. Note that each domain may run its own interior
routing protocols and use any scheme it chooses to assign metrics to
paths. This means that it is impossible to calculate meaningful path
costs for a path that crosses multiple autonomous systems. A cost of
1000 across one provider might imply a great path, but it might mean an
unacceptably bad one from another provider. As a result, interdomain
routing advertises only <em>reachability</em>. The concept of reachability is
basically a statement that “you can reach this network through this AS.”
This means that for interdomain routing to pick an optimal path is
essentially impossible.</p>
<p>The autonomous nature of interdomain raises issue of trust. Provider&nbsp;A
might be unwilling to believe certain advertisements from provider&nbsp;B for
fear that provider&nbsp;B will advertise erroneous routing information. For
example, trusting provider&nbsp;B when he advertises a great route to
anywhere in the Internet can be a disastrous choice if provider&nbsp;B turns
out to have made a mistake configuring his routers or to have
insufficient capacity to carry the traffic.</p>
<p>The issue of trust is also related to the need to support complex
policies as noted above. For example, I might be willing to trust a
particular provider only when he advertises reachability to certain
prefixes, and thus I would have a policy that says, “Use AS X to reach
only prefixes <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(q\)</span>, if and only if AS X advertises
reachability to those prefixes.”</p>

<h3>Basics of BGP<a class="headerlink" href="#basics-of-bgp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each AS has one or more <em>border routers</em> through which packets enter and
leave the AS. In our simple example in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-autonomous"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 3</span></a>,
routers R2 and R4 would be border routers. (Over the years, routers have
sometimes also been known as <em>gateways</em>, hence the names of the
protocols BGP and EGP). A border router is simply an IP router that is
charged with the task of forwarding packets between autonomous systems.</p>
<p>Each AS that participates in BGP must also have at least one <em>BGP</em>
speaker, a router that “speaks” BGP to other BGP speakers in other
autonomous systems. It is common to find that border routers are also
BGP speakers, but that does not have to be the case.</p>
<p>BGP does not belong to either of the two main classes of routing
protocols, distance-vector or link-state. Unlike these protocols, BGP
advertises <em>complete paths</em> as an enumerated list of autonomous systems
to reach a particular network. It is sometimes called a <em>path-vector</em>
protocol for this reason. The advertisement of complete paths is
necessary to enable the sorts of policy decisions described above to be
made in accordance with the wishes of a particular AS. It also enables
routing loops to be readily detected.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 101: </span><span class="caption-text">Example of a network running BGP.</span></p>
</div>
<p>To see how this works, consider the very simple example network in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-bgpeg"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 5</span></a>. Assume that the providers are transit networks,
while the customer networks are stubs. A BGP speaker for the AS of
provider&nbsp;A (AS&nbsp;2) would be able to advertise reachability information
for each of the network numbers assigned to customers P and Q. Thus, it
would say, in effect, “The networks 128.96, 192.4.153, 192.4.32, and
192.4.3 can be reached directly from AS&nbsp;2.” The backbone network, on
receiving this advertisement, can advertise, “The networks 128.96,
192.4.153, 192.4.32, and 192.4.3 can be reached along the path (AS 1,&nbsp;AS
2).” Similarly, it could advertise, “The networks 192.12.69, 192.4.54,
and 192.4.23 can be reached along the path (AS 1,&nbsp;AS 3).”</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 102: </span><span class="caption-text">Example of loop among autonomous systems.</span></p>
</div>
<p>An important job of BGP is to prevent the establishment of looping
paths. For example, consider the network illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-aspath"><span class="std std-ref">Figure
6</span></a>. It differs from <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-bgpeg"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 5</span></a> only in the
addition of an extra link between AS 2 and AS 3, but the effect now is
that the graph of autonomous systems has a loop in it. Suppose AS&nbsp;1
learns that it can reach network 128.96 through AS&nbsp;2, so it advertises
this fact to AS&nbsp;3, who in turn advertises it back to AS&nbsp;2. In the
absence of any loop prevention mechanism, AS&nbsp;2 could now decide that
AS&nbsp;3 was the preferred route for packets destined for 128.96. If AS&nbsp;2
starts sending packets addressed to 128.96 to AS&nbsp;3, AS&nbsp;3 would send them
to AS&nbsp;1; AS&nbsp;1 would send them back to AS&nbsp;2; and they would loop forever.
This is prevented by carrying the complete AS path in the routing
messages. In this case, the advertisement for a path to 128.96 received
by AS&nbsp;2 from AS&nbsp;3 would contain an AS&nbsp;path of (AS&nbsp;3, AS&nbsp;1, AS&nbsp;2, AS&nbsp;4).
AS&nbsp;2 sees itself in this path, and thus concludes that this is not a
useful path for it to use.</p>
<p>In order for this loop prevention technique to work, the AS numbers
carried in BGP clearly need to be unique. For example, AS&nbsp;2 can only
recognize itself in the AS path in the above example if no other AS
identifies itself in the same way. AS numbers are now 32-bits long, and
they are assigned by a central authority to assure uniqueness.</p>
<p>A given AS will only advertise routes that it considers good enough for
itself. That is, if a BGP speaker has a choice of several different
routes to a destination, it will choose the best one according to its
own local policies, and then that will be the route it advertises.
Furthermore, a BGP speaker is under no obligation to advertise any route
to a destination, even if it has one. This is how an AS can implement a
policy of not providing transit—by refusing to advertise routes to
prefixes that are not contained within that AS, even if it knows how to
reach them.</p>
<p>Given that links fail and policies change, BGP speakers need to be able
to cancel previously advertised paths. This is done with a form of
negative advertisement known as a <em>withdrawn route</em>. Both positive and
negative reachability information are carried in a BGP update message,
the format of which is shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-bgpup"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 7</span></a>. (Note that the
fields in this figure are multiples of 16&nbsp;bits, unlike other packet
formats in this chapter.)</p>

</div>
<p>Unlike the routing protocols described in the previous chapter, BGP is
defined to run on top of TCP, the reliable transport protocol. Because
BGP speakers can count on TCP to be reliable, this means that any
information that has been sent from one speaker to another does not need
to be sent again. Thus, as long as nothing has changed, a BGP speaker
can simply send an occasional <em>keepalive</em> message that says, in effect,
“I’m still here and nothing has changed.” If that router were to crash
or become disconnected from its peer, it would stop sending the
keepalives, and the other routers that had learned routes from it would
assume that those routes were no longer valid.</p>

<p>Having said that policies may be arbitrarily complex, there turn out to
be a few common ones, reflecting common relationships between autonomous
systems. The most common relationships are illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-as-rels"><span class="std std-ref">Figure

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 104: </span><span class="caption-text">Common AS relationships.</span></p>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Provider-Customer—</em>Providers are in the business of connecting
their customers to the rest of the Internet. A customer might be
a&nbsp;corporation, or it might be a smaller ISP (which may have customers
of its own). So the common policy is to advertise all the routes I
know about to my customer, and advertise routes I learn from my
customer to everyone.</li>
<li><em>Customer-Provider—</em>In the other direction, the customer wants to
get traffic directed to him (and his customers, if he has them) by
his provider, and he wants to be able to send traffic to the rest of
the Internet through his provider. So the common policy in this case
is&nbsp;to advertise my own prefixes and routes learned from my customers
to my provider, advertise routes learned from my provider to my
customers, but don’t advertise routes learned from one provider to
another provider. That last part is to make sure the customer doesn’t
find himself in the business of carrying traffic from one provider to
another, which isn’t in his interests if he is paying the providers
to carry traffic for him.</li>
<li><em>Peer—</em>The third option is a symmetrical peering between autonomous
systems. Two providers who view themselves as equals usually peer so
that they can get access to each other’s customers without having to
pay another provider. The typical policy here is to advertise routes
learned from my customers to my peer, advertise routes learned from
my peer to my customers, but don’t advertise routes from my peer to
any provider or <em>vice versa</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing to note about this figure is the way it has brought back some
structure to the apparently unstructured Internet. At the bottom of
the&nbsp;hierarchy we have the stub networks that are customers of one or
more providers, and as we move up the hierarchy we see providers who
have other providers as their customers. At the top, we have providers
who have customers and peers but are not customers of anyone. These
providers are known as the <em>Tier-1</em> providers.</p>
<div class="admonition-key-takeaway admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Key Takeaway</p>
<p class="last">Let’s return to the real question: How does all this help us to build
scalable networks? First, the number of nodes participating in BGP is
on the order of the number of autonomous systems, which is much
smaller than the number of networks. Second, finding a good
interdomain route is only a matter of finding a path to the right
border router, of which there are only a few per AS. Thus, we have
neatly subdivided the routing problem into manageable parts, once
again using a new level of hierarchy to increase scalability. The
complexity of interdomain routing is now on the order of the number
of autonomous systems, and the complexity of intradomain routing is
on the order of the number of networks in a single AS.</p>

<h3>Integrating Interdomain and Intradomain Routing<a class="headerlink" href="#integrating-interdomain-and-intradomain-routing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While the preceding discussion illustrates how a BGP speaker learns
interdomain routing information, the question still remains as to how
all the other routers in a domain get this information. There are
several ways this problem can be addressed.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a very simple situation, which is also very common. In
the case of a stub AS that only connects to other autonomous systems at
a single point, the border router is clearly the only choice for all
routes that are outside the AS. Such a router can inject a <em>default
route</em> into the intradomain routing protocol. In effect, this is a
statement that any network that has not been explicitly advertised in
the intradomain protocol is reachable through the border router. Recall
from the discussion of IP forwarding in the previous chapter that the
default entry in the forwarding table comes after all the more specific
entries, and it matches anything that failed to match a specific entry.</p>
<p>The next step up in complexity is to have the border routers inject
specific routes they have learned from outside the AS. Consider, for
example, the border router of a provider&nbsp;AS that connects to a customer
AS. That router could learn that the network prefix 192.4.54/24 is
located inside the customer AS, either through BGP or because the
information is configured into the border router. It could inject a
route to that prefix into the routing protocol running inside the
provider&nbsp;AS. This would be an advertisement of the sort, “I have a link
to 192.4.54/24 of cost X.” This would cause other routers in the
provider&nbsp;AS to learn that this border router is the place to send
packets destined for that prefix.</p>
<p>The final level of complexity comes in backbone networks, which learn so
much routing information from BGP that it becomes too costly to inject
it into the intradomain protocol. For example, if a border router wants
to inject 10,000 prefixes that it learned about from another AS, it will
have to send very big link-state packets to the other routers in that
AS, and their shortest-path calculations are going to become very
complex. For this reason, the routers in a backbone network use a
variant of BGP called <em>interior BGP</em> (iBGP) to effectively redistribute
the information that is learned by the BGP speakers at the edges of the
AS to all the other routers in the AS. (The other variant of BGP,
discussed above, runs between autonomous systems and is called <em>exterior
BGP</em>, or eBGP). iBGP enables any router in the AS to learn the best
border router to use when sending a packet to any address. At the same
time, each router in the AS keeps track of how to get to each border
router using a conventional intradomain protocol with no injected
information. By combining these two sets of information, each router in
the AS is able to determine the appropriate next hop for all prefixes.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 105: </span><span class="caption-text">Example of interdomain and intradomain routing. All
routers run iBGP and an intradomain routing protocol. Border
routers A, D, and E also run eBGP to other autonomous
systems.</span></p>
</div>
<p>To see how this all works, consider the simple example network,
representing a single AS, in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ibgp"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 9</span></a>. The three border
routers, A, D, and E, speak eBGP to other autonomous systems and learn
how to reach various prefixes. These three border routers communicate
with other and with the interior routers B and C by building a mesh of
iBGP sessions among all the routers in the AS. Let’s now focus in on how
router B builds up its complete view of how to forward packets to any
prefix. Look at the top left of <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-ibgptab"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 10</span></a>, which shows
the information that router B learns from its iBGP sessions. It learns
that some prefixes are best reached via router A, some via D, and some
via E. At the same time, all the routers in the AS are also running some
intradomain routing protocol such as Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
or Open Shortest Path First (OSPF). (A generic term for intradomain
protocols is an interior gateway protocol, or IGP.) From this completely
separate protocol, B learns how to reach other nodes <em>inside</em> the
domain, as shown in the top right table. For example, to reach router E,
B needs to send packets toward router&nbsp;C. Finally, in the bottom table, B
puts the whole picture together, combining the information about
external prefixes learned from iBGP with the information about interior
routes to the border routers learned from the&nbsp;IGP. Thus, if a prefix
like 18.0/16 is reachable via border router E, and the best interior
path to E is via C, then it follows that any packet destined for 18.0/16
should be forwarded toward C. In this way, any router in the AS can
build up a complete routing table for any prefix that is reachable via
some border router of the AS.</p>

<h2>IP Version 6 (IPv6)<a class="headerlink" href="#ip-version-6-ipv6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In many respects, the motivation for a new version of IP is simple: to
deal with exhaustion of the IP address space. CIDR helped considerably
to contain the rate at which the Internet address space is being
consumed and also helped to control the growth of routing table
information needed in the Internet’s routers. However, there will come a
point at which these techniques are no longer adequate. In particular,
it is virtually impossible to achieve 100% address utilization
efficiency, so the address space will be exhausted well before the 4
billionth host is connected to the Internet. Even if we were able to use
all 4&nbsp;billion addresses, it’s not too hard to imagine ways that that
number could be exhausted, now that IP addresses are assigned not just
to full-blown computers but also to mobile phones, televisions, and
other household appliances. All of these possibilities argue that a
bigger address space than that provided by 32&nbsp;bits will eventually be
needed.</p>
<div class="section" id="historical-perspective">
<h3>Historical Perspective<a class="headerlink" href="#historical-perspective" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The IETF began looking at the problem of expanding the IP address space
in 1991, and several alternatives were proposed. Since the IP address is
carried in the header of every IP packet, increasing the size of the
address dictates a change in the packet header. This means a new version
of the Internet Protocol and, as a consequence, a need for new software
for every host and router in the Internet. This is clearly not a trivial
matter—it is a major change that needs to be thought about very
carefully.</p>
<p>The effort to define a new version of IP was known as IP Next
Generation, or IPng. As the work progressed, an official IP version
number was assigned, so IPng is now known as IPv6. Note that the version
of IP discussed so far in this chapter is version 4 (IPv4). The apparent
discontinuity in numbering is the result of version number 5 being used
for an experimental protocol many years ago.</p>
<p>The significance of changing to a new version of IP caused a snowball
effect. The general feeling among network designers was that if you are
going to make a change of this magnitude you might as well fix as many
other things in IP as possible at the same time. Consequently, the IETF
solicited white papers from anyone who cared to write one, asking for
input on the features that might be desired in a new version of IP. In
addition to the need to accommodate scalable routing and addressing,
some of the other wish list items for IPng included:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Support for real-time services</li>
<li>Security support</li>
<li>Autoconfiguration (i.e., the ability of hosts to automatically
configure themselves with such information as their own IP address
and domain name)</li>
<li>Enhanced routing functionality, including support for mobile hosts</li>
</ul>
<p>It is interesting to note that, while many of these features were absent
from IPv4 at the time IPv6 was being designed, support for all of them
has made its way into IPv4 in recent years, often using similar
techniques in both protocols. It can be argued that the freedom to think
of IPv6 as a clean slate facilitated the design of new capabilities for
IP that were then retrofitted into IPv4.</p>
<p>In addition to the wish list, one absolutely non-negotiable feature for
IPng was that there must be a transition plan to move from the current
version of IP (version&nbsp;4) to the new version. With the Internet being so
large and having no centralized control, it would be completely
impossible to have a “flag day” on which everyone shut down their hosts
and routers and installed a new version of IP. Thus, we can expect there
to be a long transition period in which some hosts and routers will run
IPv4 only, some will run IPv4 and IPv6, and some will run IPv6 only. (So
far, that transition period has lasted over 20 years!)</p>
<p>The IETF appointed a committee called the IPng Directorate to collect
all the inputs on IPng requirements and to evaluate proposals for a
protocol to become IPng. Over the life of this committee there were
numerous proposals, some of which merged with other proposals, and
eventually one was chosen by the Directorate to be the basis for IPng.
That proposal was called <em>Simple Internet Protocol Plus</em> (SIPP). SIPP
originally called for a doubling of the IP address size to 64&nbsp;bits. When
the Directorate selected SIPP, they stipulated several changes, one of
which was another doubling of the address to 128&nbsp;bits (16&nbsp;bytes). It was
around this time that version number 6 was assigned. The rest of this
section describes some of the main features of IPv6. At the time of this
writing, most of the key specifications for IPv6 are Proposed or Draft
Standards in the IETF.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="addresses-and-routing">
<h3>Addresses and Routing<a class="headerlink" href="#addresses-and-routing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>First and foremost, IPv6 provides a 128-bit address space, as opposed to
the 32&nbsp;bits of version 4. Thus, while version 4 can potentially address
4&nbsp;billion nodes if address assignment efficiency reaches 100%, IPv6 can
address 3.4 × 10<sup>38</sup> nodes, again assuming 100% efficiency.
As we have seen, though, 100%
efficiency in address assignment is not likely. Some analysis of other
addressing schemes, such as those of the French and U.S. telephone
networks, as well as that of IPv4, have turned up some empirical numbers
for address assignment efficiency. Based on the most pessimistic
estimates of efficiency drawn from this study, the IPv6 address space is
predicted to provide over 1500 addresses per square foot of the Earth’s
surface, which certainly seems like it should serve us well even when
toasters on Venus have IP addresses.</p>

<div class="section" id="address-space-allocation">
<h3>Address Space Allocation<a class="headerlink" href="#address-space-allocation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Drawing on the effectiveness of CIDR in IPv4, IPv6 addresses are also
classless, but the address space is still subdivided in various ways
based on the leading bits. Rather than specifying different address
classes, the leading bits specify different uses of the IPv6 address.

<p>This allocation of the address space warrants a little discussion.
First, the entire functionality of IPv4’s three main address classes (A,
B, and C) is contained inside the “everything else” range. Global
Unicast Addresses, as we will see shortly, are a lot like classless IPv4
addresses, only much longer. These are the main ones of interest at this
point, with over 99% of the total IPv6 address space available to this
important form of address. (At the time of writing, IPv6 unicast
addresses are being allocated from the block that begins <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">001</span></code>, with
the remaining address space—about 87%—being reserved for future use.)</p>
<p>The multicast address space is (obviously) for multicast, thereby
serving the same role as class&nbsp;D addresses in IPv4. Note that multicast
addresses are easy to distinguish—they start with a byte of all 1s. We
will see how these addresses are used in a later section.</p>
<p>The idea behind link-local use addresses is to enable a host to
construct an address that will work on the network to which it is
connected without being concerned about the global uniqueness of the
address. This may be useful for autoconfiguration, as we will see below.
Similarly, the site-local use addresses are intended to allow valid
addresses to be constructed on a site (e.g., a private corporate
network) that is not connected to the larger Internet; again, global
uniqueness need not be an issue.</p>
<p>Within the global unicast address space are some important special types
of addresses. A node may be assigned an IPv4-compatible IPv6 address by
zero-extending a 32-bit IPv4 address to 128&nbsp;bits. A node that is only
capable of understanding IPv4 can be assigned an IPv4-mapped IPv6
address by prefixing the 32-bit IPv4 address with 2&nbsp;bytes of all 1s and
then zero-extending the result to 128&nbsp;bits. These two special address
types have uses in the IPv4-to-IPv6 transition (see the sidebar on this
topic).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="address-notation">
<h3>Address Notation<a class="headerlink" href="#address-notation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Just as with IPv4, there is some special notation for writing down IPv6
addresses. The standard representation is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x</span></code>, where
each <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code> is a hexadecimal representation of a 16-bit piece of the
address. An example would be</p>
<div class="highlight-c notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">47</span><span class="nl">CD</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">1234</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">4422</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="nl">ACO2</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mo">0022</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mi">1234</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="nl">A456</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mo">0124</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Any IPv6 address can be written using this notation. Since there are a
few special types of IPv6 addresses, there are some special notations
that may be helpful in certain circumstances. For example, an address
with a large number of contiguous 0s can be written more compactly by
omitting all the 0 fields. Thus,</p>
<div class="highlight-c notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">47</span><span class="nl">CD</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mo">0000</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mo">0000</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mo">0000</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mo">0000</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="mo">0000</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="nl">A456</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mo">0124</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>could be written</p>
<div class="highlight-c notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mi">47</span><span class="n">CD</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="nl">A456</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mo">0124</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Clearly, this form of shorthand can only be used for one set of
contiguous 0s in an address to avoid ambiguity.</p>
<p>The two types of IPv6 addresses that contain an embedded IPv4 address
have their own special notation that makes extraction of the IPv4
address easier. For example, the IPv4-mapped IPv6 address of a host
whose IPv4 address was 128.96.33.81 could be written as</p>
<div class="highlight-c notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">::</span><span class="nl">FFFF</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mf">128.96.33.81</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That is, the last 32&nbsp;bits are written in IPv4 notation, rather than as a
pair of hexadecimal numbers separated by a colon. Note that the double
colon at the front indicates the leading&nbsp;0s.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="global-unicast-addresses">
<h3>Global Unicast Addresses<a class="headerlink" href="#global-unicast-addresses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>By far the most important sort of addressing that IPv6 must provide is
plain old unicast addressing. It must do this in a way that supports the
rapid rate of addition of new hosts to the Internet and that allows
routing to be done in a scalable way as the number of physical networks
in the Internet grows. Thus, at the heart of IPv6 is the unicast address
allocation plan that determines how unicast addresses will be assigned
to service providers, autonomous systems, networks, hosts, and routers.</p>
<p>In fact, the address allocation plan that is proposed for IPv6 unicast
addresses is extremely similar to that being deployed with CIDR in IPv4.
To understand how it works and how it provides scalability, it is
helpful to define some new terms. We may think of a nontransit AS (i.e.,
a stub or multihomed AS) as a <em>subscriber</em>, and we may think of a
transit AS as a <em>provider</em>. Furthermore, we may subdivide providers into
<em>direct</em> and <em>indirect</em>. The former are directly connected to
subscribers. The latter primarily connect other providers, are not
connected directly to subscribers, and are often known as <em>backbone</em>
<em>networks</em>.</p>
<p>With this set of definitions, we can see that the Internet is not just
an arbitrarily interconnected set of autonomous systems; it has some
intrinsic hierarchy. The difficulty lies in making use of this hierarchy
without inventing mechanisms that fail when the hierarchy is not
strictly observed, as happened with EGP. For example, the distinction
between direct and indirect providers becomes blurred when a subscriber
connects to a backbone or when a direct provider starts connecting to
many other providers.</p>
<p>As with CIDR, the goal of the IPv6 address allocation plan is to provide
aggregation of routing information to reduce the burden on intradomain
routers. Again, the key idea is to use an address prefix—a set of
contiguous bits at the most significant end of the address—to aggregate
reachability information to a large number of networks and even to a
large number of autonomous systems. The main way to achieve this is to
assign an address prefix to a direct provider and then for that direct
provider to assign longer prefixes that begin with that prefix to its
subscribers. Thus, a provider can advertise a single prefix for all of
its subscribers.</p>
<p>Of course, the drawback is that if a site decides to change providers,
it will need to obtain a new address prefix and renumber all the nodes
in the site. This could be a colossal undertaking, enough to dissuade
most people from ever changing providers. For this reason, there is
ongoing research on other addressing schemes, such as geographic
addressing, in which a site’s address is a function of its location
rather than the provider to which it attaches. At present, however,
provider-based addressing is necessary to make routing work efficiently.</p>
<p>Note that while IPv6 address assignment is essentially equivalent to the
way address assignment has happened in IPv4 since the introduction of
CIDR, IPv6 has the significant advantage of not having a large installed
base of assigned addresses to fit into its plans.</p>
<p>One question is whether it makes sense for hierarchical aggregation to
take place at other levels in the hierarchy. For example, should all
providers obtain their address prefixes from within a prefix allocated
to the backbone to which they connect? Given that most providers connect
to multiple backbones, this probably doesn’t make sense. Also, since the
number of providers is much smaller than the number of sites, the
benefits of aggregating at this level are much fewer.</p>
<p>One place where aggregation may make sense is at the national or
continental level. Continental boundaries form natural divisions in the
Internet topology. If all addresses in Europe, for example, had a common
prefix, then a great deal of aggregation could be done, and most routers
in other continents would only need one routing table entry for all
networks with the Europe prefix. Providers in Europe would all select
their prefixes such that they began with the European prefix. Using this
scheme, an IPv6 address might look like <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-v6addr"><span class="std std-ref">Figure 11</span></a>. The
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">RegistryID</span></code> might be an identifier assigned to a European address
registry, with different IDs assigned to other continents or countries.
Note that prefixes would be of different lengths under this scenario.
For example, a provider with few customers could have a longer prefix
(and thus less total address space available) than one with many
customers.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id12">
<span id="fig-v6addr"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f04-11-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f04-11-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f04-11-9780123850591.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 107: </span><span class="caption-text">An IPv6 provider-based unicast address.</span></p>
</div>
<p>One tricky situation could occur when a subscriber is connected to more
than one provider. Which prefix should the subscriber use for his or her
site? There is no perfect solution to the problem. For example, suppose
a subscriber is connected to two providers,&nbsp;X and&nbsp;Y. If the subscriber
takes his prefix from X, then Y has to advertise a prefix that has no
relationship to its other subscribers and that as a consequence cannot
be aggregated. If the subscriber numbers part of his AS with the prefix
of X and part with the prefix of Y, he runs the risk of having half his
site become unreachable if the connection to one provider goes down. One
solution that works fairly well if X and Y have a lot of subscribers in
common is for them to have three prefixes between them: one for
subscribers of X only, one for subscribers of Y only, and one for the
sites that are subscribers of both X and&nbsp;Y.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="packet-format">
<h3>Packet Format<a class="headerlink" href="#packet-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Despite the fact that IPv6 extends IPv4 in several ways, its header
format is actually simpler. This simplicity is due to a concerted effort
to remove unnecessary functionality from the protocol. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-v6header"><span class="std std-ref">Figure
12</span></a> shows the result.</p>
<p>As with many headers, this one starts with a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Version</span></code> field, which is
set to 6 for IPv6. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Version</span></code> field is in the same place relative
to the start of the header as IPv4’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Version</span></code> field so that
header-processing software can immediately decide which header format to
look for. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TrafficClass</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FlowLabel</span></code> fields both relate to
quality of service issues.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PayloadLen</span></code> field gives the length of the packet, excluding the
IPv6 header, measured in bytes. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NextHeader</span></code> field cleverly
replaces both the IP options and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Protocol</span></code> field of IPv4. If
options are required, then they are carried in one or more special
headers following the IP header, and this is indicated by the value of
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NextHeader</span></code> field. If there are no special headers, the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NextHeader</span></code> field is the demux key identifying the higher-level
protocol running over IP (e.g., TCP or UDP); that is, it serves the same
purpose as the IPv4 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Protocol</span></code> field. Also, fragmentation is now
handled as an optional header, which means that the
fragmentation-related fields of IPv4 are not included in the IPv6
header. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">HopLimit</span></code> field is simply the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TTL</span></code> of IPv4, renamed to
reflect the way it is actually used.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id13">
<span id="fig-v6header"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f04-12-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f04-12-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f04-12-9780123850591.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 108: </span><span class="caption-text">IPv6 packet header.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Finally, the bulk of the header is taken up with the source and
destination addresses, each of which is 16&nbsp;bytes (128&nbsp;bits) long. Thus,
the IPv6 header is always 40&nbsp;bytes long. Considering that IPv6 addresses
are four times longer than those of IPv4, this compares quite well with
the IPv4 header, which is 20&nbsp;bytes long in the absence of options.</p>
<p>The way that IPv6 handles options is quite an improvement over IPv4. In
IPv4, if any options were present, every router had to parse the entire
options field to see if any of the options were relevant. This is
because the options were all buried at the end of the IP header, as an
unordered collection of ‘(type, length, value)’ tuples. In contrast,
IPv6 treats options as <em>extension headers</em> that must, if present, appear
in a specific order. This means that each router can quickly determine
if any of the options are relevant to it; in most cases, they will not
be. Usually this can be determined by just looking at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NextHeader</span></code>
field. The end result is that option processing is much more efficient
in IPv6, which is an important factor in router performance. In
addition, the new formatting of options as extension headers means that
they can be of arbitrary length, whereas in IPv4 they were limited to
44&nbsp;bytes at most. We will see how some of the options are used below.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id14">
<span id="fig-v6ext"></span><a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/f04-13-9780123850591.png"><img alt="../_images/f04-13-9780123850591.png" src="../_images/f04-13-9780123850591.png" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Figure 109: </span><span class="caption-text">IPv6 fragmentation extension header.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Each option has its own type of extension header. The type of each
extension header is identified by the value of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NextHeader</span></code> field
in the header that precedes it, and each extension header contains a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NextHeader</span></code> field to identify the header following it. The last
extension header will be followed by a transport-layer header (e.g.,
TCP) and in this case the value of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NextHeader</span></code> field is the same
as the value of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Protocol</span></code> field would be in an IPv4 header. Thus,
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NextHeader</span></code> field does double duty; it may either identify the
type of extension header to follow, or, in the last extension header, it
serves as a demux key to identify the higher-layer protocol running over
IPv6.</p>
<p>Consider the example of the fragmentation header, shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-v6ext"><span class="std std-ref">Figure
13</span></a>. This header provides functionality similar to the
fragmentation fields in the IPv4 header, but it is only present if
fragmentation is necessary. Assuming it is the only extension header
present, then the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NextHeader</span></code> field of the IPv6 header would contain
the value&nbsp;<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">44</span></code>, which is the value assigned to indicate the
fragmentation header. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NextHeader</span></code> field of the fragmentation
header itself contains a value describing the header that follows it.
Again, assuming no other extension headers are present, then the next
header might be the TCP header, which results in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NextHeader</span></code>
containing the value&nbsp;<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">6</span></code>, just as the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Protocol</span></code> field would in
IPv4. If the fragmentation header were followed by, say, an
authentication header, then the fragmentation header’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NextHeader</span></code>
field would contain the value&nbsp;<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">51</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="autoconfiguration">
<h3>Autoconfiguration<a class="headerlink" href="#autoconfiguration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While the Internet’s growth has been impressive, one factor that has
inhibited faster acceptance of the technology is the fact that getting
connected to the Internet has typically required a fair amount of system
administration expertise. In particular, every host that is connected to
the Internet needs to be configured with a certain minimum amount of
information, such as a valid IP address, a subnet mask for the link to
which it attaches, and the address of a name server. Thus, it has not
been possible to unpack a new computer and connect it to the Internet
without some preconfiguration. One goal of IPv6, therefore, is to
provide support for autoconfiguration, sometimes referred to as
<em>plug-and-play</em> operation.</p>
<p>As we saw in the previous chapter, autoconfiguration is possible for
IPv4, but it depends on the existence of a server that is configured to
hand out addresses and other configuration information to Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) clients. The longer address format in IPv6
helps provide a useful, new form of autoconfiguration called <em>stateless</em>
autoconfiguration, which does not require a server.</p>
<p>Recall that IPv6 unicast addresses are hierarchical, and that the least
significant portion is the interface ID. Thus, we can subdivide the
autoconfiguration problem into two parts:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Obtain an interface ID that is unique on the link to which the host
is attached.</li>
<li>Obtain the correct address prefix for this subnet.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first part turns out to be rather easy, since every host on a link
must have a unique link-level address. For example, all hosts on an
Ethernet have a unique 48-bit Ethernet address. This can be turned into
a valid link-local use address by adding the appropriate prefix from
<cite>Table 1 &lt;fig-v6tab&gt;</cite> (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1111</span> <span class="pre">1110</span> <span class="pre">10</span></code>) followed by enough 0s to make up
128&nbsp;bits. For some devices—for example, printers or hosts on a small
routerless network that do not connect to any other networks—this
address may be perfectly adequate. Those devices that need a globally
valid address depend on a router on the same link to periodically
advertise the appropriate prefix for the link. Clearly, this requires
that the router be configured with the correct address prefix, and that
this prefix be chosen in such a way that there is enough space at the
end (e.g., 48&nbsp;bits) to attach an appropriate link-level address.</p>
<p>The ability to embed link-level addresses as long as 48&nbsp;bits into IPv6
addresses was one of the reasons for choosing such a large address size.
Not only does 128&nbsp;bits allow the embedding, but it leaves plenty of
space for the multilevel hierarchy of addressing that we discussed
above.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="advanced-routing-capabilities">
<h3>Advanced Routing Capabilities<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-routing-capabilities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Another of IPv6’s extension headers is the routing header. In the
absence of this header, routing for IPv6 differs very little from that
of IPv4 under CIDR. The routing header contains a list of IPv6 addresses
that represent nodes or topological areas that the packet should visit
en route to its destination. A topological area may be, for example, a
backbone provider’s network. Specifying that packets must visit this
network would be a way of implementing provider selection on a
packet-by-packet basis. Thus, a host could say that it wants some
packets to go through a provider that is cheap, others through a
provider that provides high reliability, and still others through a
provider that the host trusts to provide security.</p>
<p>To provide the ability to specify topological entities rather than
individual nodes, IPv6 defines an <em>anycast</em> address. An anycast address
is assigned to a set of interfaces, and packets sent to that address
will go to the “nearest” of those interfaces, with nearest being
determined by the routing protocols. For example, all the routers of a
backbone provider could be assigned a single anycast address, which
would be used in the routing header.</p>
<p>The anycast address and the routing header are also expected to be used
to provide enhanced routing support to mobile hosts. The detailed
mechanisms for providing this support are still being defined.</p>

<div class="section" id="other-features">
<h3>Other Features<a class="headerlink" href="#other-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the primary motivation
behind the development of IPv6 was to support the continued growth of
the Internet. Once the IP header had to be changed for the sake of the
addresses, however, the door was open for a wide variety of other
changes, two of which we have just described—autoconfiguration and
source-directed routing. IPv6 includes several additional features, most
of which are covered elsewhere in this book; e.g., mobility, security,
quality-of-service. It is interesting to note that, in most of these
areas, the IPv4 and IPv6 capabilities have become virtually
indistinguishable, so that the main driver for IPv6 remains the need for
larger addresses.</p>
