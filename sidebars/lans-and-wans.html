  <!--- [!Note|style:flat|label:SANs, LANs, MANs, and WANs|iconVisibility:hidden] ---><blockquote>
<div><p><strong>SANs, LANs, MANs, and WANs</strong></p>
<p>One way to characterize networks is according to their size. Two
well-known examples are LANs (local area networks) and WANs (wide area
networks); the former typically extend less than 1&nbsp;km, while the
latter can be worldwide. Other networks are classified as MANs
(metropolitan area networks), which usually span tens of kilometers.
The reason such classifications are interesting is that the size of a
network often has implications for the underlying technology that can
be used, with a key factor being the amount of time it takes for data
to propagate from one end of the network to the other; we discuss this
issue more in later chapters.</p>
<p>An interesting historical note is that the term “wide area network”
was not applied to the first WANs because there was no other sort of
network to differentiate them from. When computers were incredibly
rare and expensive, there was no point in thinking about how to
connect all the computers in the local area—there was only one
computer in that area. Only as computers began to proliferate did LANs
become necessary, and the term “WAN” was then introduced to describe
the larger networks that interconnected geographically distant
computers.</p>
<p>Another kind of network that we need to be aware of is SANs (usually
now expanded as storage area networks, but formerly also known as
system area networks). SANs are usually confined to a single room and
connect the various components of a large computing system. For
example, Fiber Channel is a common SAN technology used to connect high
performance computing systems to storage servers and data vaults.
Although this book does not describe such networks in detail, they are
worth knowing about because they are often at the leading edge in
terms of performance, and because it is increasingly common to connect
such networks into LANs and WANs.</p>
