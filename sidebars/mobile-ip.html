<div><p><strong>Mobile Ad Hoc Networks</strong></p>
<p>For most of this section, we’ve been assuming that only the end nodes
(hosts) are mobile. This is certainly a good description of the way
most of us deal with networks today. Our laptops and phones move
around, and connect to fixed infrastructure, such as cell towers and
802.11 access points, which connect over fixed links to the Internet’s
backbone. However, many modern routers are also quite small enough to
be mobile, and there are environments where mobile routers would be
useful, such as building networks among moving vehicles. Because
routing protocols are dynamic, you might imagine that the occasional
mobile router would not be a problem, and that is roughly correct.
However, what if all or most of the nodes in a network where mobile?
Taken to the logical extreme, you could have a network with no fixed
infrastructure at all—just a collection of mobile nodes, some or all
of which function as routers. Would standard routing protocols work in
such an environment?</p>
<p>The environment where everything is mobile and there is no fixed
infrastructure is often called a Mobile ad-hoc network, or MANET (the
latter being the name of an IETF working group tackling the problem
space). To understand why special solutions might be needed for the
mobile ad-hoc environment, consider the fact that, unlike a fixed
network, the neighbors of any given ad-hoc router are likely to change
very frequently as the nodes move. Since any change in neighbor
relationships typically requires a routing protocol message to be
sent, and a new routing table to be calculated, it’s easy to see that
there may be concerns about using a protocol not optimized for this
environment. Compounding this issue is the fact that communication is
likely to be wireless, which consumes power, and many mobile nodes are
likely to run off power-constrained batteries. Link bandwidths are
also likely to be constrained. Hence, reducing the overhead caused by
sending routing protocol messages, and re-flooding them to all one’s
neighbors, is a key concern for ad-hoc routing.</p>
<p>Several approaches to optimizing routing for mobile ad-hoc
environments have been developed over the years. These are broadly
characterized as “reactive” and “proactive” approaches. OLSR
(Optimized Link State Routing) is the dominant proactive approach, and
its name give a good sense of what it is: it resembles a conventional
link-state protocol (like OSPF), with a number of optimizations to
reduce the amount of flooding of routing messages. Reactive protocols
include AODV (Ad-hoc On demand Distance Vector) and DYMO (Dynamic
MANET On-demand), both of which are based on distance vector
protocols. These approaches seek to reduce the amount of routing
protocol overhead by only building routes as needed, e.g. when a given
node has traffic for a particular destination. There is a rich
solution space in which tradeoffs can be made, and this space
continues to be explored.</p>
