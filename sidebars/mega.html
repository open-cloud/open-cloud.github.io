<div><p><strong>How Big is a Mega?</strong></p>
<p>There are several pitfalls you need to be aware of when working with
the common units of networking, such as MB and Mbps. The first is
to distinguish carefully between bits and bytes. Throughout this book,
we always use a lowercase <em>b</em> for bits and a capital <em>B</em> for bytes.
The second is to be sure you are using the appropriate definition of
giga (G), mega (M) and kilo (K). <em>Mega,</em> for example, can mean either
2$$^{20}$$ or 10$$^6$$. Similarly, <em>kilo</em> can be either 2$$^{10}$$ or
10$$^3$$ and <em>giga</em> can be either 2$$^{30}$$ or 10$$^9$$.
What is worse, in networking we typically use both definitions. Here’s
why.</p>
<p>Network bandwidth, which is often specified in terms of Mbps, is
typically governed by the speed of the clock that paces the
transmission of the bits. A clock that is running at 10&nbsp;MHz is used to
transmit bits at 10&nbsp;Mbps. Because the <em>mega</em> in MHz means
10$$^6$$&nbsp;hertz, Mbps is usually also defined as 10$$^6$$ bits per second.
(Similarly, Gbps is 10$$^9$$ bits per second.) On the other hand, when
we talk about a message that we want to transmit, we often give its
size in bytes. Because messages are stored in the computer’s
memory, and memory is typically measured in powers of two, the <em>K</em> in
KB is usually taken to mean 2$$^{10}$$. (Similarly, MB usually means
2$$^{20}$$ and GB usually means 2$$^{30}$$.) When you put the two
together, it is not uncommon to talk about sending a 32-KB message
over a 10-Mbps channel, which should be interpreted to mean 32 x
2$$^{10}$$ x 8 bits are being transmitted at a rate of 10 x 10$$^6$$
bits per second. This is the interpretation we use throughout the
book, unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p>
<p>The good news is that many times we are satisfied with a
back-of-the-envelope calculation, in which case it is perfectly
reasonable to make the approximation that 10$$^6$$ is really equal to
2$$^{20}$$ (making it easy to convert between the two definitions of
mega). This approximation introduces only a 5% error. We can even make
the approximation in some cases that a byte has 10 bits, a 20% error
but good enough for order-of-magnitude estimates.</p>
<p>While we’re making quick-and-dirty calculations, 100&nbsp;ms is a
reasonable number to use for a cross-country round-trip time—at
least when the country in question is the United States—and 1&nbsp;ms is
a good approximation of an RTT across a local area network. In the
case of the former, we increase the 48-ms round-trip time implied by
the speed of light over a fiber to 100&nbsp;ms because there are, as we
have said, other sources of delay, such as the processing time in the
switches inside the network. You can also be sure that the path taken
by the fiber between two points will not be a straight line.</p>
