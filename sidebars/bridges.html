<div><p><strong>Bridges, Switches, and Routers</strong></p>
<p>It is easy to become confused about the distinction between bridges,
switches, and routers. There is good reason for such confusion, since
at some level, they all forward messages from one link to another. One
distinction people make is based on layering: Bridges are link-level
nodes (they forward frames from one link to another to implement an
extended LAN), switches are network-level nodes (they forward packets
from one link to another to implement a packet-switched network), and
routers are internet-level nodes (they forward datagrams from one
network to another to implement an internet).</p>
<p>The distinction between bridges and switches is now pretty much
obsolete. For example, we have already seen that a multiport bridge is
usually called an Ethernet switch or LAN switch. For this reason,
bridges and switches are often grouped together as “layer 2 devices,”
where layer 2 in this context means “above the physical layer, below
the internet layer.”</p>
<p>Historically there have been important distinctions between LAN
switches (or bridges) and WAN switches. LAN switches traditionally
depend on the spanning tree algorithm, while WAN switches generally
run routing protocols that allow each switch to learn the topology of
the whole network. This is an important distinction because knowing
the whole network topology allows the switches to discriminate among
different routes, while in contrast, the spanning tree algorithm locks
in a single tree over which messages are forwarded. It is also the
case that the spanning tree approach does not scale as well. Again,
this distinction is under threat as routing protocols from the wide
area have made their way into LAN switches.</p>
<p>What about switches and routers? Internally, they look quite similar
(as the section on switch and router implementation will illustrate).
The key distinction is the sort of packet they forward: IP datagrams
in the case of routers, and “layer 2” packets (usually Ethernet
frames) in the case of switches.</p>
<p>One big difference between a network built from switches and the
Internet built from routers is that the Internet is able to
accommodate heterogeneity, whereas switched networks typically
consists of homogeneous links. This support for heterogeneity is one
of the key reasons why the Internet is so widely deployed. It is also
the fact that IP runs <em>over</em> virtually every other protocol (including
ATM and Ethernet) that now causes those protocols to be viewed as
“layer 2” technologies.</p>
