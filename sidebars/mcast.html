<div><p><strong>Fate of Multicast Protocols</strong></p>
<p>A number of IP multicast protocols have fallen by the wayside since
the 1991 publication of Steve Deering’s doctoral thesis, “Multicast
Routing in a Datagram Network.” In most cases, their downfall had
something to do with scaling. The most successful early multicast
protocol was DVMRP, which we discussed at the start of the section.
The <em>Multicast Open Shortest Path First</em> (MOSPF) protocol was based on
the OSPF unicast routing protocol. PIM dense mode (PIM-DM) has some
similarity to DVMRP, in that it also uses a flood-and-prune approach;
at the same time it is like PIM-SM in being independent of the unicast
routing protocol used. All of these protocols are more appropriate to
a “dense” domain, i.e., one with a high proportion of routers
interested in the multicast. These protocols all appeared relatively
early in the history of multicast, before some of the scaling
challenges were fully apparent. Although they would still make sense
within a domain for multicast groups expected to be of “dense”
interest, they are rarely used today, in part because the routers
usually must support PIM-SM anyway.</p>
<p><em>Core-Based Trees</em> (CBT) was another approach to multicast that was
proposed at about the same time as PIM. The IETF was initially unable
to choose between the two approaches, and both PIM and CBT were
advanced as “experimental” protocols. However, PIM was more widely
adopted by industry, and the main technical contributions of
CBT—shared trees, and bidirectional trees—were ultimately
incorporated into PIM-SM and BIDIR-PIM respectively.</p>
<p>Despite all of this attention to generality and scalability, multicast
has ultimately had the greatest impact at the edge of the Internet—the
last hop where edge devices (most noteably, Internet-capable set-top
boxes connected to your TV) connect to an edge IP router. At this
point in the network, inter-domain multicast is not a big concern. The
main thing the ISP cares about is to avoid transmiting the same video
stream over N separate point-to-point connections just because N of
their subscribers are watching the same TV channel.  Instead, each of
those devices joins the multicast group that corresponds to the
channel the viewer is watching, and the edge router can deliver a
single multicast stream to reach all of them. For this scenario, the
edge devices use the <em>Internet Group Management Protocol</em> (IGMP) to
manage multicast groups.</p>
