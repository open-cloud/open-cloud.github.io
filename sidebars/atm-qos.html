  <!--- [!Note|style:flat|label:ATM Quality of Service|iconVisibility:hidden] ---><blockquote>
<div><p><strong>ATM Quality of Service</strong></p>
<p>ATM is a much less important technology today than it was 20 years
ago, but one of its real contributions was in the area of QoS. It’s
fair to say that ATM’s being designed with fairly rich QoS
capability was one of the things that spurred interest in QoS for IP.</p>
<p>In many respects, the QoS capabilities that are provided in ATM
networks are similar to those provided in an IP network using
Integrated Services. However, the ATM standards bodies came up with a
total of five service classes compared to the IETF’s three. The
five ATM service classes are</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>constant bit rate (CBR)</li>
<li>variable bit rate—real-time (VBR-rt)</li>
<li>variable bit rate—non-real-time (VBR-nrt)</li>
<li>available bit rate (ABR)</li>
<li>unspecified bit rate (UBR)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly the ATM and IP service classes are quite similar, but one of
them, ABR, has no real counterpart in IP. More on ABR in a moment.
VBR-rt is very much like the guaranteed service class in IP Integrated
Services. The exact parameters that are used to set up a VBR-rt VC are
slightly different than those used to make a guaranteed service
reservation, but the basic idea is the same. The traffic generated by
the source is characterized by a token bucket, and the maximum total
delay required through the network is specified. CBR is also similar
to guaranteed service except that sources of CBR traffic are expected
to send at a constant rate. Note that this is really a special case of
VBR, where the source’s peak rate and average rate of transmission are
equal.</p>
<p>VBR-nrt bears some similarity to IP’s controlled load service. Again,
the source traffic is specified by a token bucket, but there is not
the same hard delay guarantee of VBR-rt or IP’s guaranteed service.
UBR is ATM’s best-effort service.</p>
<p>Finally, we come to ABR, which is more than just a service class; it
also defines a set of congestion-control mechanisms. It is rather
complex, so we mention only the high points.</p>
<p>The ABR mechanisms operate over a virtual circuit by exchanging
special ATM cells called resource management (RM) cells between the
source and destination of the VC. The goal of sending the RM cells is
to get information about the state of congestion in the network back
to the source so that it can send traffic at an appropriate rate. In
this respect, RM cells are an explicit congestion feedback mechanism.
This is similar to the DECbit,
but contrasts with TCP’s use of implicit
feedback, which depends on packet losses to detect congestion. It is
also similar to the new “quick-start” mechanism for TCP.</p>
<p>Initially, the source sends the cell to the destination and includes
in it the rate at which it would like to send data cells. Switches
along the path look at the requested rate and decide if sufficient
resources are available to handle that rate, based on the amount of
traffic being carried on other circuits. If enough resources are
available, the RM cell is passed on unmodified; otherwise, the
requested rate is decreased before the cell is passed along. At the
destination, the RM cell is turned around and sent back to the source,
which thereby learns what rate it can send at.</p>
<p>The intention of ABR is to allow a source to increase or decrease its
allotted rate as conditions dictate. Hence, RM cells are sent
periodically and may contain either higher or lower requested rates.
Also, the rate at which a source is allowed to send decays with time
if not used. In general, proprietary algorithms in the switches
determine the rates that are placed in RM cells as they pass through
the switches; the algorithms draw on a variety of information such as
the current buffer occupancy and the measured arrival rates on
currently active VCs. These algorithms, as is normal for
congestion-control algorithms, seek to maximize throughput and to keep
delay and loss low.</p>
<p>Given the relative decline of ATM in real networks today, the
interesting point of ATM QoS is how many mechanisms are common across
different technologies. Mechanisms that are found in both ATM and IP
QoS include admission control, scheduling algorithms, token bucket
policers, and explicit congestion feedback mechanisms.</p>
