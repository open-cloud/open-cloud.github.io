<div><p><strong>When Loss Doesn’t Mean Congestion</strong></p>
<p>There is one situation in which TCP congestion control has the
potential to fail spectacularly. When a link drops packets at a
relatively high rate due to bit errors—something that is fairly common
on wireless links—TCP misinterprets this is a signal of congestion.
Consequently, the TCP sender reduces its rate, which typically has no
effect on the rate of bit errors, so the situation can continue until
the send window drops to a single packet. At this point, the
throughput achieved by TCP will deteriorate to one packet per round
trip time, which may be much less than the appropriate rate for a
network that is not actually experiencing congestion.</p>
<p>Given this situation, you may wonder how it is that TCP works at all
over wireless networks. Fortunately, there are a number of ways to
address the problem. Most commonly, some steps are taken at the link
layer to reduce or hide packet losses due to bit errors. For example,
802.11 networks apply forward error correction (FEC) to the
transmitted packets so that some number of errors can be corrected by
the receiver. Another approach is to do link layer retransmission, so
that even if a packet is corrupted and dropped, it eventually gets
sent successfully, and the initial loss never becomes apparent to TCP.
Each of these approaches have their problems: FEC wastes some
bandwidth and will sometimes still fail to correct errors, while
retransmission increases both the RTT of the connection and its
variance, leading to worse performance.</p>
<p>Another approach used in some situations is to “split” the TCP
connection into wireless and wired segments. There are many variations
on this idea, but the basic approach is to treat losses on the wired
segment as congestion signals but treat losses on the wireless segment
as being caused by bit errors. This sort of technique has been used in
satellite networks, where the RTT is so long already that you really
don’t want to make it any longer. Unlike the link-layer approaches,
however, this one is a fundamental change to the end-to-end operation
of the protocol; it also means that the forward and reverse paths of
the connection have to pass through the same “middlebox” that is doing
the splitting of the connection.</p>
<p>Another set of approaches try to distinguish intelligently between the
two difference classes of loss, congestion and bit-errors. There are
clues that losses are due to congestion such as increasing RTT and
correlation among successive losses. ECN marking can also provide an
indication that congestion is imminent, so a subsequent loss is more
likely to be congestion-related. Clearly, if you can detect the
difference between the two types of loss, then TCP doesn’t need to
reduce its window for for bit-error-related losses. Unfortunately, it
is hard to make this determination with 100% accuracy.</p>
