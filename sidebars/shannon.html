<div><p><strong>Shannon-Hartley Theorem</strong></p>
<p>There has been an enormous body of work done in the related areas of
signal processing and information theory, studying everything from how
signals degrade over distance to how much data a given signal can
effectively carry. The most notable piece of work in this area is a
formula known as the <em>Shannon-Hartley theorem</em>. Simply stated,
this theorem gives an upper bound to the capacity of a link, in terms
of bits per second (bps), as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio
of the link, measured in decibels (dB), and the bandwidth of the
channel, measured in Hertz (Hz). (As noted previously, “bandwidth” is
a bit of an overloaded term in communications; here we use it to refer
to the range of frequencies available for communication.)</p>
<p>As an example, we can apply the Shannon-Hartley theorem to determine
the rate at which we can expect to transmit data over a voice-grade
phone line without suffering from too high an error rate. A standard
voice-grade phone line typically supports a frequency range of 300 Hz
to 3300 Hz, a channel bandwidth of 3 kHz.</p>
<p>The theorem is typically given by the following formula:
$$C = B \log_2 (1 + S/N)$$ where $$C$$ is the achievable channel
capacity measured in bits per second, $$B$$ is the bandwidth of the
channel in Hz (3300 Hz - 300 Hz = 3000 Hz), $$S$$ is the average
signal power, and $$N$$ is the
average noise power. The signal-to-noise ratio ($$S/N$$, or SNR) is
usually expressed in decibels, related as follows:
$$\mathsf{SNR} = 10 \times \log_{10}(S/N)$$. Thus, a typical
signal-to-noise ratio of 30&nbsp;dB would imply that $$S/N = 1000$$.
Thus, we have $$C = 3000 \times \log_2(1001)$$ which equals
approximately 30 Kbps.</p>
<p>When dial-up modems were the main way to connect to the Internet in
the 1990s, 56 kbps was a common advertised capacity for a modem (and
continues to be about the upper limit for dial-up). However, the
modems often achieved lower speeds in practice, because they didn’t
always encounter a signal-to-noise ratio high enough to achieve
56kbps.</p>
<p>The Shannon-Hartley theorem is equally applicable to all sorts of
links ranging from wireless to coaxial cable to optical fiber. It
should be apparent that there are really only two ways to build a high
capacity link: start with a high bandwidth channel, or achieve a high
signal to noise ratio. But even those
conditions won’t guarantee a high capacity link—it often takes quite
a bit of ingenuity on the part of people who design channel coding
schemes to achieve the theoretical limits of a channel. This ingenuity
is particularly apparent today in wireless links, where there is a
great incentive to get the most bits per second from a given amount of
wireless spectrum (the channel bandwidth) and signal power level (and
hence SNR).</p>
