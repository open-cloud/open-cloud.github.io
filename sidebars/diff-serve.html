  <!--- [!Note|style:flat|label:Quiet Success of DiffServ|iconVisibility:hidden] ---><blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Quiet Success of DiffServ</strong></p>
<p>As early as 2003, many people were ready to declare that DiffServ
was dead. At that year’s ACM SIGCOMM conference, one of the most
prestigious networking research conferences, a workshop with the
provocative title “RIPQOS” was held—the official name of the
workshop was “Revisiting IP QoS” but the implication that QOS might be
ready to rest in peace was clear in the workshop announcement.
However, just as Mark Twain quipped that reports of his death were
greatly exaggerated, it seems that the demise of IP QoS, and DiffServ
in particular, was also overstated.</p>
<p>Much of the pessimism about DiffServ arose from the fact that is had
not been deployed to any significant extent by Internet Service
Providers. Not only that, but the fact that real-time applications
such as IP telephony and video streaming appear to be working so well
over the Internet without any QoS mechanisms in place makes one wonder
if any QoS will every be needed. In part this is the result of
aggressive deployment of high bandwidth links and routers by many
ISPs.</p>
<p>To see where DiffServ has succeeded, you need to look outside the ISP
backbones. For example, corporations that have deployed IP telephony
solutions—and there are over ten million “enterprise class” IP
phones in use at the time of writing—routinely use “EF” behavior for
the voice media packets to ensure that they are not delayed when
sharing links with other traffic. The same holds for many residential
voice-over-IP solutions: just to get priority on the upstream link out
of the residence (e.g. the “slow” direction of a DSL link), it is
common for the voice endpoint to set the DSCP to EF, and for a
consumer’s router connected to the broadband link to use DiffServ to
give low latency and jitter to those packets.</p>
<p>There are other applications beside voice that are benefiting from
IP-based video in the coming years will provide another driver. In
general, two factors make DiffServ deployment worthwhile: a high
demand for QoS assurance from the application, and a lack of assurance
that the link bandwidth will be sufficient to deliver that QoS to
<em>all</em> the traffic traversing the link. It is important to realize that
DiffServ, like any other QoS mechanism, cannot create bandwidth—all
it can do is ensure that what bandwidth there is gets preferentially
allocated to the applications that have more demanding QoS needs.</p>
