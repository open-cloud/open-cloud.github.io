<p>Contributors are encouraged to discuss major contributions (e.g., significant
rewrites or new sections/chapters) on the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">discuss&#64;systemsapproach.org</span></code>
mailing list before putting in a lot of effort. The first step is to
<a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/a/systemsapproach.org/forum/#%21forum/discuss">join the forum</a>.</p>
<p>Also, while GitHub is a great place to archive and track revisions over time,
it is often the case that a shared Google Document is a better tool for
collaboration. This is true not only for from-scratch efforts, but
also as a way to get comments and feedback on a fairly complete
draft. If you’re game, we have a shared
<a class="reference external" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1diDcXKTyMFyuR7g1M6gTRuCnHXAUYj7C?ths=true">Google Drive Folder</a>.</p>
<p>If you have new material that doesn’t fit into the current book
organization in an obvious way, check it into one of the following
repositories:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/SystemsApproach/sdn">sdn</a>: Sections or articles
related to Software-Defined Networking.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/SystemsApproach/cloud">cloud</a>: Sections or
articles related to cloud networking, both how Internet protocols
have been adapted to work in data centers and how the cloud has
impacted the greater Internet.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/SystemsApproach/tools">tools</a>: Tutorials or user
guides describing diagnostic, monitoring, visualization, or analysis
tools that can be used to gain insight into the how the Internet
works in practice.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/SystemsApproach/advanced-topics">advanced-topics</a>:
Sections or articles on any other advanced topic.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is likely a stop-gap solution. We’ll figure out the best way to
organize material (both old and new) over time.</p>
<p>As for stylistic guidelines, there are only a few things to keep in mind.</p>
<p>First, try to keep each major topic (what corresponded to a chapter in
the original textbook) self-contained, with minimal forward- or
backward-references to other material. The idea is that each chapter
should be able to stand alone. (Think self-contained software module
with no hard-coded dependencies.)</p>
<p>Second, adhere to best practices using MarkDown. Run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span> <span class="pre">lint</span></code> on any
new text you write. See
https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/blob/master/docs/RULES.md
for the rules being applied. This may seem pedantic, but it’s
important that the raw MarkDown be easily read, edited, and compared.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> We’re relaxed the “No Inline HTML” rule (MD033) to allow
for the current treatment of Figures and Tables. This will
eventually be corrected, and we suggest otherwise abiding by the
rule.</div></blockquote>
<p>Third, when creating figures, reuse as many of the existing graphical
elements as possible and stick to the current color scheme. Check in
both editable source (currently <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.eps</span></code>) and a PNG file (300 dpi) for each
figure.</p>
<p>Finally, keep the <em>Systems Approach</em> in mind as you write. To quote the
Preface in the original book:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Approach</strong></p>
<p>For an area that’s as dynamic and changing as computer
networks, the most important thing a textbook can offer is
perspective—to distinguish between what’s important and what’s not,
and between what’s lasting and what’s superficial. Based on our
experience over the past 25-plus years doing research that has led to new
networking technology, teaching undergraduate and graduate students
about the latest trends in networking, and delivering advanced
networking products to market, we have developed a perspective—which
we call the <em>systems approach</em>—that forms the soul of this
book. The systems approach has several implications:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>First Principles.</em> Rather than accept existing artifacts as gospel, we
start with first principles and walk you through the thought process that
led to today’s networks. This allows us to explain <em>why</em> networks look
like they do.  It is our experience that once you understand the
underlying concepts, any new protocol that you are confronted with
will be relatively easy to digest.</li>
<li><em>Non-layerist.</em> Although the material is loosely organized around the
traditional network layers, starting at the bottom and moving up the
protocol stack, we do not adopt a rigidly layerist approach. Many
topics—congestion control and security are good examples—have
implications up and down the hierarchy, and so we discuss them outside
the traditional layered model. Similarly, routers and switches have so
much in common (and are often combined as single products) that we
discuss them in the same chapter. In short, we believe layering makes a
good servant but a poor master; it’s more often useful to take an
end-to-end perspective.</li>
<li><em>Real-world Examples.</em> Rather than explain how protocols work in the
abstract, we use the most important protocols in use today—most of them
from the TCP/IP Internet—to illustrate how networks work in practice. This
allows us to include real-world experiences in the discussion.</li>
<li><em>Software.</em> Although at the lowest levels networks are constructed from
commodity hardware that can be bought from computer vendors and
communication services that can be leased from the phone company, it
is the software that allows networks to provide new services and adapt
quickly to changing circumstances.  It is for this reason that we
emphasize how network software is implemented, rather than stopping
with a description of the abstract algorithms involved. We also include
code segments taken from a working protocol stack to illustrate how
you might implement certain protocols and algorithms.</li>
<li><em>End-to-end Focus.</em> Networks are constructed from many building-block
pieces, and while it is necessary to be able to abstract away uninteresting
elements when solving a particular problem, it is essential to
understand how all the pieces fit together to form a functioning
network. We therefore spend considerable time explaining the overall
end-to-end behavior of networks, not just the individual components,
so that it is possible to understand how a complete network operates,
all the way from the application to the hardware.</li>
<li><em>Performance.</em> The systems approach implies doing experimental
performance studies, and then using the data you gather both to quantitatively
analyze various design options and to guide you in optimizing the
implementation. This emphasis on empirical analysis pervades the book.</li>
<li><em>Design Principles.</em> Networks are like other computer
systems—for example, operating
systems, processor architectures, distributed and parallel systems,
and so on. They are all large and complex. To help manage this
complexity, system builders often draw on a collection of design
principles. We highlight these design principles as they are
introduced throughout the book, illustrated, of course, with examples
from computer networks.</li>
</ul>
